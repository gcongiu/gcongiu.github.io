## About Me

I am a Research Scientist working in the Performance Group at Innovative
Computing Laboratory (ICL), University of Tennessee Knoxville. Before joining
ICL in July 2022 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL), where I worked in the Programming Models and Runtime Systems group.
Before ANL I also worked in industry, at Xyratex and Seagate, while persuing
my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Mainz in Germany.

During my years at Xyratex and Seagate I was involved in several EU funded
Exascale Computing projects such as [DEEP-ER](www.deep-projects.eu),
[SAGE](https://www.sagestorage.eu) and [EsiWace](www.esiwace.eu). A common
theme for all these projects was the improvement of I/O performance for
scientific workloads. This was achieved, in part, by reingegneering existing
I/O middlewares and libraries. In DEEP-ER this resulted into the extension of
the MPI-IO hints mechanism to take advantage of non-volatile memory devices
locally attached to compute nodes in a HPC cluster, effectively adding a new
storage layer between main memory and the parallel file system that could be
used as burst buffer for checkpoint operations.

At Argonne National Laboratory I was involved in the development of new features
for the [MPICH Project](www.mpich.org), implementation of the MPI standard. This
included the integration and support of new memory technologies (e.g. HBM) and
GPU accelerators.

Currently, I am involved in the [PAPI Project](https://icl.utk.edu/papi/). PAPI
is a software library allowing users to tap into the hardware performance
counters, nowadays present in all major hardware components (ranging from CPU to
network cards), to understand and improve the interaction between hardware and
software. PAPI is the industry standard for hardware performance monitoring and
is used by many other successful packages such as HPCToolkit and Tau.
