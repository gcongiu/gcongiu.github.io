## About Me

I am a Research Scientist working in the Performance Group at Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL), University of Tennessee Knoxville. Before joining ICL in July 2022 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), where I worked in the Programming Model and Runtime Systems group. Before ANL I also worked in industry, at Xyratex and Seagate, while persuing my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Mainz in Germany.
